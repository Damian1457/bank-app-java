## java-bank-app

>The project aims to create a simulation of a part of a banking application in Java. The main
goal of the project is to carry out the software development process, which consists of
analysis, design, implementation, testing and deployment.<br/><br/>
>The application allows users to create a bank, set up user accounts, deposit and withdraw
money, transfer funds from account to account, and read a list of current bank customers.
Each user is given a unique ID and bank account number, and all data is stored in a database.<br/><br/>
>The application's code is tested using JUnit, and it uses Maven and Git for project
management. It also uses an H2 or PostgreSQL database.
The project is under constant development, with plans to add new functionality in the future.
